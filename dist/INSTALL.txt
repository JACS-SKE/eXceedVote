We can't make our project run with JAR because we separate the project into 2 parts. 1. eXceedVote 2. eXceedVoteServer
This cause some problems such as we can't call "Properties" file, can't use "this.getClass.getResource" to call image or fonts that have been put in and also problems on Server too.

Therefore, we would like you to import our project in eclipse and run by do as follows

1. import eXceedVoteServer into eclipse and run Main class(src/jacs/Main) to open the server and the management system.
2. import eXceedVote into eclipse and change ip in "properties.txt" file to the same ip as the server's computer. In this case, it's your laptop's ip.
3. Run Main class(src/jacs/Main) to access to the main user interface.

We are really sorry that can't run with JAR and sorry for any inconvenience.
